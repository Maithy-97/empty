# Customize the Run button to reload the browser
# Typically for HTML/CSS labs, we just open the page in browser preview,
# but this ties the button to opening the file in preview.

# Optional additional terminals (optional)
# If you want to run any server or commands, specify them here:
# terminals:
#   - "echo 'Welcome to the HTML/CSS Lab!'"
#   - "echo 'You can remove these or add your own commands'"
